# Cancer Cells Binary Classification

This is a mini Machine Learning project made using Numpy, Streamlit, Pandas, and Scikit-learn  
libraries to classify a given cancer cell as Malignant or Benign. The model has been trained on  
the Cell Samples dataset which contains 600+ rows of features like 'Clump', 'UnifSize', 'UnifShape', 
'MargAdh', 'SingEpiSize', 'BareNuc', 'BlandChrom', 'NormNucl', 'Mit' classified as Malignant or Benign.

Information about the features:
1. Clump: Clump Thickness – Measures the thickness of cell clusters.
2. UnifSize: Uniformity of Cell Size – Evaluates how consistent the sizes of cells are.
3. UnifShape: Uniformity of Cell Shape – Assesses the uniformity in the shapes of cells.
4. MargAdh: Marginal Adhesion – Indicates how well cells adhere to each other at the margins.
5. SingEpiSize: Single Epithelial Cell Size – Represents the size of isolated epithelial cells.
6. BareNuc: Bare Nuclei – Refers to nuclei that are not surrounded by cytoplasm.
7. BlandChrom: Bland Chromatin – Describes the texture and appearance of chromatin in the nucleus.
8. NormNucl: Normal Nucleoli – Evaluates the presence and appearance of nucleoli in cells.
9. Mit: Mitoses – Counts the number of mitotic figures, indicating cell division activity.
